# Anomaly-Detection
Machine Learning assignment done during the first semester of M.Tech. The aim of the assignment is given below. All the steps used for the assignmet are give in the `KDD Cup 1999.ipynb` file. The `KDD Cup 1999.ipynb` can be opened using Jupyter Notebook.

This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between "bad" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and "good" normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.<br>

<i>NOTE: If you go to the link you will find that the dataset(when uncompressed) is 743M in size. Due to the vast computationl time and resources that is needed to process a dataset of that size, I have decided to use the following two dataset for training and testing:<i><br>
<i>Training: kddcup.data_10_percent.gz A 10% subset. (2.1M; 75M Uncompressed) <i><br>
<i>Testing: kddcup.newtestdata_10_percent_unlabeled.gz (1.4M; 45M Uncompressed)<i><br>
<i>Labels of test data: corrected.gz Test data with corrected labels.<i></br>
